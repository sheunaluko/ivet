# About this github repository 

This repository contains two main subdirectories, <b>src</b> and <b>raw_data</b>.  

<b>src: </b>
This directory contains all of the client side javascript code for building the web interface. iVET was developed using the [create react app tool](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and thus
the source code is in javascript and react's jsx syntax.

<b>raw_data: </b>
This directory contains raw csv data files which were used to populate the cloud database that iVET queries during runtime. It also contains json files which define terminologies used by the application.
